## Running the project
###Front end
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

In order to install angular-cli, first you need to install the latest version of NodeJS and npm.

Then open a terminal and run the following command

`npm install -g angular-cli`

Once angular-cli is install, navigate to the root of the project and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Now you are ready to run compile and serve the web site by running `ng serve`.

###Server Side

You also need NodeJS to run the server side code, but by now you should have installed it. So go to the root directory of the server side code (where the T360Server/package.json is) and the following commands

```
npm install

node bin/www
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
